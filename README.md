# Neurocomputers

It is believed that new computer that will perform more and more complex tasks should employ principles of the human brain. This kind of computer, called neurocomputer, consists of many interconnected units - so called neurons - performing simple nonlinear transformations in parallel. Its major aim is not general-purpose computation, but pattern recognition using associative memory. There are various types of neurocomputers, including feedforward neural network, Hopfieldâ€™s network and many more. The most promising are these mimicing rhythmic behaviour of the brain - oscillatory neural networks.

In this project, we introduce the Neurocomputers topic by studing first Hopfields model and later Oscillatory Neural Network model for pattern recognition. In both models we explain all the theory behind the network, perform simulations on different examples and discuss its performance.

The project consists of:
- notebooks with experiments regarding the Hopfield model and the Neurocomputers,
- report from theory and experiments,
- project presentation.
